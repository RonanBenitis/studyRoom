# Ronan's study room

Hello, mate!

This is my study room, where i publicize (and control the documents) of what i am studying right now and the path that i took on previous studies.
I'm using this repository as a learning process of Git and GitHub too, so, expect testing here! :)

>**MODEL_NOTEBOOK-ANOTATION AND JUPYTER NB**
>- Today, i'm using Jupyter Notebook as platform for my anotations and documentations. Even if i can't run the specific snipet on different languages than Python, i loved the organizational structer of a Notebook. Using it i don't have to create lots of documents, like what is done in "Guanabara > Mundo 01", creating one document for anotations and a ton for exercises. Using Jupyter Notebok, i can anotate in Markdown (instead of commenting on code) and mescling with coding snipet! When in Python, even run it! For my buddies starting in Programming, i would recommend it!
>- In the main, you'll see my model to start a notebook document.

Let's do this!
