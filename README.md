Hello, mate!

Welcome to my study room, where I publicize and control the documents related to what i am currently studying and the paths i took in previous studies. I'm using this repository as part of my learning process with Git and GitHub, so expect some testing here! :)

>**Model Notebook - Annotations and Jupyter NB**
>
>- Today, I'm using Jupyter Notebook as the platform for my annotations and documentation. Even if I can't run specific snippets in languages other than Python, I love the organizational structure of a notebook. Using it, I don't have to create lots of files like in "Guanabara > Mundo 01," where one file is for annotations and a ton are for exercises. With Jupyter Notebook, I can annotate in Markdown (instead of commenting directly on the code) and mix it with coding snippets! When in Python, I can even run the code! For my buddies starting in programming, I highly recommend it!
>- In the main directory, you'll see my template for starting a notebook document.

Let's do this!
